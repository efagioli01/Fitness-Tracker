I accidently cloned a new repo inside of my original repo, I then created a new repo called fitness tracker to push to Heroku which is the Github repo below in the repository section.

## Description

The goal of this project was to build a workout tracker application.The app allows users to create and track daily workouts. The user is able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. They are able to track the name of the exercise, the type, weight used , how many sets, how many reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is cardio they can track the type of cardio, distance traveled, and the amount of time it took.
